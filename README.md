# youtube_upload

This is a rework of the YouTube upload script that Google provides.  This version fixes the lack of support Google provides for Python 3.

I found it unusable to not support Python 3 when looking at the examples on this Google page: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/uploading_a_video

This code rewrites their sample code to be working Python 3 code.

I use this script to have my raspberry pi upload a daily timelapse of the weather to YouTube.
